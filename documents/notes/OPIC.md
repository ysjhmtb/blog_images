### 자기소개

Hello, Eva. Nice to meet you. My name is Yunseok Jeon. But you can just call me Yun.

I'm in my early thirty. I'm not married and living with my family.

There are three people: my mother, young sister and me.

My mother work for a goverment and my sister work for a data analyst.

I'm currently looking for a job.

I'd like to find a position in a computer engineer.

When I have free time, I enjoy studying algorithms and reading books about computer.

I think I'm a curious person and  a introspective a bit.

I will tell you about my house.

I live in an apartment near Chonho station. 

It's on the fisrt floor of a twenty-three story apartment building.

My house is very clean and bright.

There are two bed room, a master room and a bathroom in my house.  

When I enter the house, there are two rooms on either side.  

After the hallway, there is a kitchen on the left. 

On the opposite side of the kitchen, there is a living room and my room.

There are two bookshelves and a desk, on which  a notebook computer and a monitor lie, in my room. 

There is a large window next to the desk in the  bedroom.

And the window has a curtain.

I like my house because I can always enough rest when I'm at home.
