> W: Jack! Why are you here at the office today? Aren’t you supposed to be on a business trip to Miami this week? You’ve been putting the documents together all month. <br>
>
> M: Yes, I was supposed to leave this morning, but there was a bad storm in Florida, so my flight was canceled. <br>
>
> W: That’s too bad. So, did you reschedule it? <br>
>
> M: Yes, but I wasn’t able to get a seat until next Tuesday evening and I had to switch from BlueSky Airlines to MasterFly Airlines. I just hope the weather is better by then. <br>

<br>

> M: Hello.  Orville Corporation customer service, Josh speaking. How may I help you? <br>
>
> W: Hi. I just bought an air conditioner in your shop last week during your 30 percent off summer promotion. When I turned it on this morning, I noticed that it was blowing warm air. <br>
>
> M: Really? I’ll send someone over to check your unit. Could you give me your address so I can pass it on to the technician?      <br>
>
> W: Sure, I live at 18 Sycamore Lane in Bayside. <br>
