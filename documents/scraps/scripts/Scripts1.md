[Why Tesla is building city-sized batteries](https://youtu.be/8ge3ah1G8ok)

> Batteries make a lot of modern tech possible. Everything from cell phones, cameras, medical devices, a million aplliances, to bigger things like electric cars. You might get frustrated because your cell phone still can't make it through the day on a single charge, but the fact is, battery technology as a whole is leaping forward. It's improving so much that batteries aren't just powering our phones and our cars, they're powering cities and even replacing entire power plants.  But storing energy on the power grid isn't a new idea. In fact, batteries are joining some really whimsical technology. Tech that might make you wonder what the definition of a battery actually is. 
>
> <br>
>
> Well, storage has been sort of the Holy Grail of the electric grid or electricity industry for a very long time, decades, really. 
>
> <br>
>
> JB Straubel is a co-founder of Tesla and its CTO. Tesla, obviously, is big into batteries for their cars, but they're also tackling city-sized energy storage, which improves on our very old  school grid. 
>
> <br>
>
> You know, the electric grid hasn't changed that much from 100-some years ago when Tesla and Edison were actually inventing it. Most people don't realize, but  it's instantaneously matched. Every time that you turn on a light switch in your house, instantaneously, a power plant, somewhere, connected to that same grid, has to ramp up a little more power output to make the light operate. 
>
>  <br>
>
> When you turn on that light, you're probably relying on a big old gas or coal fired plant. Fossil fuels account for about 60% of electricity in the U.S. and another 20% comes from nuclear. Big plants are steady, but they're not very flexible. 
>
> <br>
>
> Generally, to power something, you have these huge base load gas plants. 
>
> <br>That's The Verge's own Angela Chen. 
>
> <br>
>
> And these are running kind of all the time, no matter what and they're pretty slow and you can't really adjust how much energy they're creating. 
>
> <br>
>
> When demand is too low, these big, slow plants actually lose money. And when demand is too high, quicker, dirtier plants called peaker plants have to switch on to keep up. And they're pretty wasteful. 
>
> <br>
>
> So you kind of get dinged on both sides. You get dinged when you don't have enough load and then when you have too much, you also get dinged inefficiency. 
>
> <br>
>
> So, traditional plants aren't super efficient, but they're consistent and therefore predictable. Renewable energy can be another story. Solar and wind power is cheap and clean and plentiful, but only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. 
>
> <br>
>
> So, inconsistency is the big worry, that, you know, it'll be a cloudy day or it'll be a still day and then all of the sudden, your aplliance won't work and that's something that no one really wants. 
>
> <br>
>
> What makes batteries so promising is that they can solve all of these problems.   When paired with big power plants, they can supply energy during peak times without polluting the way that peaker plants do. And when paired with renewables, they can jump in when clouds roll over a solar farm. Energy storage really is the missing piece of the puzzle for renewable energy. But when we say storage, we don't just necessarily mean these. On a super broad level, a battery is like a bank for energy. You deposit energy into it when you don't need it and withdraw it when you do.  We use electrical energy on the gird, but we can store it as any kind of energy. 
>
> <br>
>
> Exhibit A: the Hoover Dam is in the news right now  because of plans to turn it into a giant battery. It would work by converting excess electricity into gravitational potential energy. 
>
> <br>
>
> So, essentially, you have the lakes. There's one at the bottom and there's one at the top. And then, when the energy is cheap, you can pump water from the bottom to the top and it kind of just stays there in the reservoir. And then when you need the energy, you open up the reservoir and the water goes crashing down and it turns this turbine and it creates this extra energy that you might need for high demand. 
>
> <br>
>
> This is called pumped hydro-electric storage and it's actually in use all over the country today. But there are other options. Flywheel storage works the same way that this little toy car does. Engineers use power to start a heavy flywheel spinning and that power gets stored via inertia. You can later harvest that inertia to generate electricity again. And weirder still is compressed air storage.  Cheap power is used to force air into a cavern or a canister, building up pressure. When power gets pricey or scarce, you can release the air to spin a turbine and power a generator. But then, there's the big newcomer. Gridscale chemical batteries. In the past few years, the price and durability of batteries have improved fast, making them suddenly useful for variable energy sources like solar. 
>
> <br>
>
> That was kind of unheard of 10 years ago. If you told someone that, hey, a lithium ion battery could do that sort of duty, storing solar energy every single day for 10 years, they wouldn't have believed it. 
>
>  <br>
>
> Batteries are still a tiny fraction of the energy storage market. This is the roughly the market share that pumped hydro waves. And this is everything else. But within that everything else, batteries are growing fast, partly because they work at any size. 
>
> <br>
>
> Well, I think the biggest thing is scalability. Batteries have this beautiful ability to vary economically, scale from gigawatt hour size of systems all the way down to 10 kiliwatt hours in your house. 
>
> <br>
>
> Batteries do have their weakenesses. They degrade over time, which you're probably noticed about your cellphone. And you can't run them indefinitely the  way that you can a fueled power plant. Once the charge is depleted, that's it. But their flexibility sets them apart from pumped hydro which is really only practical on the scale of a lake. The point is, big batteries let us do a couple of exciting things. They let us spread out the responsibility of getting power to where it's needed. And they help patch together the mixed bag of power sources that we're juggling right now. 
>
> <br>
>
> I think what you're seeing now is you used to have an entire city would be powered by, you know, two or three huge power plants. And now you're seeing it's more distributed, so there's definitely a role we can have some of your energy from solar, some of your energy from the grid. It doesn't have to be one or the other.
>
> <br>
>
> Of course, the dream of green energy isn't a mix of fossil fuels and other technologies. It's 100% renewables like solar and wind. But if we're going to go all the way, we're going to need a lot more batteries.

[Peter Thiel | Full Speech | 2016 Republican National Convention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTJB8AkT1dk)



[Read Peter Thiel's Speech at the Republican National Convention](http://time.com/4417679/republican-convention-peter-thiel-transcript/)

> Good evening. I’m Peter Thiel. I build companies and I’m supporting people who are building new things, from social networks to rocket ships. I’m not a politician. But neither is Donald Trump. He is a builder, and it’s time to rebuild America.
>
> Where I work in Silicon Valley, it’s hard to see where America has gone wrong. My industry has made a lot of progress in computers and in software, and, of course, it’s made a lot of money. But Silicon Valley is a small place. Drive out to Sacramento, or even just across the bridge to Oakland, and you won’t see the same prosperity. That’s just how small it is.
>
> Across the country, wages are flat. Americans get paid less today than ten years ago. But healthcare and college tuition cost more every year. Meanwhile Wall Street bankers inflate bubbles in everything from government bonds to Hillary Clinton’s speaking fees. Our economy is broken. If you’re watching me right now, you understand this better than any politician in Washington D.C.
>
> And you know this isn’t the dream we looked forward to. Back when my parents came to America looking for that dream, they found it right here in Cleveland. They brought me here as a one-year-old and this is where I became an American. Opportunity was everywhere. My dad studied engineering at Case Western Reserve University, just down the road from where we are now. Because in 1968, the world’s high tech capital wasn’t just one city: all of America was high tech.
>
> It’s hard to remember this, but our government was once high tech, too. When I moved to Cleveland, defense research was laying the foundations for the internet. The Apollo program was just about to put a man on the moon–and it was Neil Armstrong, from right here in Ohio. The future felt limitless.
>
> But today our government is broken. Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks. Our newest fighter jets can’t even fly in the rain. And it would be kind to say the government’s software works poorly, because much of the time it doesn’t even work at all. That is a staggering decline for the country that completed the Manhattan project. We don’t accept such incompetence in Silicon Valley, and we must not accept it from our government.
>
> Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East. We don’t need to see Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails: her incompetence is in plain sight. She pushed for a war in Libya, and today it’s a training ground for ISIS. On this most important issue Donald Trump is right. It’s time to end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country.
>
> When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union. And we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?
>
> Of course, every American has a unique identity. I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all I am proud to be an American. I don’t pretend to agree with every plank in our party’s platform; but fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump.
>
> While it is fitting to talk about who we are, today it’s even more important to remember where we came from. For me that is Cleveland, and the bright future it promised.
>
> When Donald Trump asks us to Make America Great Again, he’s not suggesting a return to the past. He’s running to lead us back to that bright future.
>
> Tonight I urge all of my fellow Americans to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.

>  Donald Trump inauguration speech: Read the full transcript below
>
>  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, fellow Americans and people of the world – thank you.
>
>  We the citizens of America have now joined a great national effort to rebuild our county and restore its promise for all our people.
>
>  Together we will determine the course of America for many, many years to come.
>
>  Together we will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.
>
>  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
>
>  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent, thank you.
>
>  Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another – but transferring it from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people.
>
>  For too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.
>
>  Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed.
>
>  The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country.
>
>  Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. While they have celebrated there has been little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
>
>  That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America today.
>
>  This is your day.
>
>  This is your celebration.
>
>  And this – the United States of America – is your country.
>
>  What truly matters is not what party controls our government but that this government is controlled by the people.
>
>  Today, January 20 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
>
>  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.
>
>  You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement –  the likes of which the world has never seen before.
>
>  At the centre of this movement is a crucial conviction – that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
>
>  Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighbourhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves.
>
>  These are just and reasonable demands
>
>  Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.
>
>  An education system flushed with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime and the gangs and the drugs which deprive people of so much unrealised potential.
>
>  We are one nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, we share one nation, one home and one glorious destiny.
>
>  Today I take an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidised the armies of other countries, while allowing the sad depletion of our own military.
>
>  We've defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own.
>
>  And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
>
>  We have made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
>
>  One by one, shutters have closed on our factories without even a thought about the millions and millions of those who have been left behind.
>
>  But that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.
>
>  We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, in every hall of power – from this day on a new vision will govern our land – from this day onwards it is only going to be America first – America first!
>
>  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
>
>  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every bone in my body and I will never ever let you down.
>
>  America will start winning again. America will start winning like never before.
>
>  We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth, we will bring back our dreams.
>
>  We will bring new roads and high roads and bridges and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.
>
>  We will get our people off welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labour.
>
>  We will follow two simple rules – buy American and hire American.
>
>  We see good will with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their nations first.
>
>  We will shine for everyone to follow.
>
>  We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and untie the world against radical Islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.
>
>  At the bed rock of our politics will be an allegiance to the United States.
>
>  And we will discover new allegiance to each other. There is no room for prejudice.
>
>  The bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when god’s people live together in unity.
>
>  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
>
>  There is no fear, we are protected and will always be protected by the great men and women of our military and most importantly we will be protected by god.
>
>  Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. As Americans, we know we live as a nation only when it is striving.
>
>  We will no longer accept politicians who are always complaining but never doing anything about it.
>
>  The time for empty talk is over, now arrives the hour of action.
>
>  Do not allow anyone to tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail, our country will thrive and prosper again.
>
>  We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, to harvest the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.
>
>  A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
>
>  We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look at the same night sky, and dream the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath by the same almighty creator.
>
>  So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean – hear these words – you will never be ignored again.
>
>  Your voice, your hopes and dreams will define your American destiny.
>
>  Your courage, goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
>
>  Together we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America safe again and yes – together we will make America great again.
>
>  Thank you.
>
>  God bless you.
>
>  And god bless America.
