## Day 1

JOY (V.O.)   

This is Disgust. She basically keeps Riley from being poisoned, physically and socially.   

DISGUST   

That is not brightly colored or shaped like a dinosaur... Hold on guys... It’s broccoli!   

DISGUST   

Well, I just saved our lives. Yeah. You're welcome.   

DAD      

Riley, if you don’t eat your dinner, you’re not going to get any dessert.   

ANGER    

Wait. Did he just say we couldn’t have dessert?   

JOY (V.O.)   

That’s Anger. He cares very deeply about things being fair.   





## Day 2

JOY (V.O.)   

I’m not actually sure what she does. And I’ve checked, there’s no place for her to go, so she’s good, we’re good. It’s all great!   

JOY (V.O.)   

Anyway! These are Riley’s memories-and they’re mostly happy, you’ll notice, not to brag.   

JOY (V.O.)   

But the REALLY important ones are over here. I don’t want to get too technical, but these are called CORE MEMORIES.   

JOY (V.O.)   

Each one came from a superimportant time in Riley’s life. Like when she first scored a goal? That was so amazing!   





## Day 3

JOY (V.O.)   

Hey look! The Golden Gate Bridge! Isn’t that great?! It’s not made out of solid gold like we thought, which is kind of a disappointment, but still!   

FEAR   

I sure am glad you told me earthquakes are a myth, Joy. Otherwise I’d be terrified right now!   

JOY    

Uh... yeah.   

ANGER    

These are my kind of people!   

DAD    

All right, just a few more blocks. We’re almost to our new house!   

ANGER    

Step on it, Daddy!   

DISGUST    

Why don't we just live in this smelly car? We've already been in it forever.   

JOY    

Which, actually, was really lucky, because that gave us plenty of time to think about what our new house is going to look like! Let’s review the top five daydreams.
