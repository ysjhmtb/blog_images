Hello, I'm calling because I'd like to to temporarily stop my mail delivery. I'm going to be out of town for the next two weeks.

<br>

Certainly, We can hold your mail here at the post office for you. But you'll need to put in your request at least a day before you leave.

<br>

That sounds great. Do I need to come into the office and complete a form?

<br>

No, actually, you have to submit the hold mail form on our Web site.

Thank you for the generous introduction, Mr. Park. I am delighted to be here tonight to receive this prestigious award. I have been an avid reader since my childhood, but my interest in writing didn't start until I was at university when I wrote for a campus newspaper. At around the same time, I started writing short stories as a hobby. I never imagined that my hobby would turn into a career! If Mr. Oberly, my agent, hadn't encouraged me to submit my writing to publishers ten years ago, I wouldn't be standing here today; so, Mr. Oberly, thank you --- I couldn't have asked for a better agent. I would also like to thank all of my readers --- I will continue to share my stories with you.

Good morning. I'm here to talk about the new security system. This week the security department will be contacting each of you to set up an appointment to get your picture taken. The security department will use the pictures to make an identification card for each employee. You must wear your identification card at all times while you're on company property. Your card will also unlock the doors of the building, so, unlike now, you will not be able to enter the building without it. We're confident the new security system will make our company a safer place to work.

Ms. Hughes? It's Martin Johnson here, the owner of the building. I'm calling to let you and other tenants know that city workers will be making some repairs on the building's waterlines on Saturday, May 12. They'll be turning off the water between 8 A.M. and 4 P.M. I would suggest making arrangements to be out of the apartment that day, since the repair work will probably be fairly noisy. Please give me a call at 555-0122 if you have any questions. Thanks.

I got our warehouse's safety report from the city inspector this morning. The inspector, Mr Yang, was here last week, and I'm happy to report that he only noted a few things we should fix so they don't become problems. Mr. Yang had one major suggestion â€” to replace the railing on the stairway. After the meeting ends, I'll e-mail a list of the other issues we need to address.

Hi, Mr. Reed, this is Margo from Tweed Menswear. I'm calling to let you know that we're finished with the alterations on the trousers you purchased. The shop will be closed next week, so if you're unable to pick them up by Friday, you'll have to wait until we reopen on September first. Thank you again for your business, and we hope to see you soon.

Welcome to the sixth annual Corzell Technology Convention. I know you're looking forward to a weekend filled with software demonstrations, workshops, and some fantastic exhibits of the latest computer technology. Those of you who participated in previous conventions will notice something new this year - we now have internet access in all our meeting rooms. One final note: if you're planning to attend the computer networking workshop, the weekend's final activity, there's been a change. It will be held in the Hudson Room, not the Bayside Center.

Hello, this is Natasha Klein. I had dinner at your restaurant last night, and I think I left my mobile phone there. I was sitting in a booth at the back of the dining room, and my purse  was on the seat. The phone must have fallen out when I took out my credit card to pay for dinner. Could you please call and let me know if the phone's been found? If so, I could stop by this afternoon to pick it up. You can reach me at my work number -- 555-0196. Thank you.

I know you've all been waiting to find out who our board of directors selected to receive the Graystone Achievement Award. This award recognizes an employee who's really contributed a lot to our work here at LC Sportwear. This year we're proud to present the award to Juan Mendez from the graphic design department. He did an outstanding job creating our new company logo. This image is what consumers see on every one of our athletic products, and Juan's striking design is sure to attract more attention.
