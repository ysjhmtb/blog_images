> While I agree that coding interviews might not be the best way to assess all your skills as a developer, there is arguably no better way to tell if you are a good engineer in a short period of time. IMO it is the necessary evil to get you that job.
> I mainly used Leetcode and Geeksforgeeks for practicing, but Hackerrank and Lintcode are also good places. I spent several weeks going over common data structures and algorithms, then focused on areas I wasn’t too familiar with, and finally did some frequently seen problems. Due to my time constraints I usually did two problems per day.
> Here are some thoughts:
>
> Practice, a lot. There is no way around it.
>
> But rather than doing all 600 problems on Leetcode, cover all types and spend time understanding each problem thoroughly. I did around 70 problems in total and felt that was enough for me. My thought is that if 70 problems isn’t helpful then you may not be doing it right and 700 won’t be helpful either.

> Go for the hardest ones. After those the rest all become easy.
>
> If stuck on one problem for over two hours, check out the solutions. More time might not be worth it.
>
> After solving one problem, check out the solutions. I was often surprised by how smart and elegant some solutions are, especially the Python one-liners.
>
> Use a language that you are most familiar with and that is common enough to be easily explained to your interviewer.
