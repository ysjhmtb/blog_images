> *The Nature of Science: Science is all about models. We look at something in real life and try to make a model of it. We can use this model to predict future (or new) events in real life. If the model doesn't agree with real data, we change the model. Repeat forever.*

> Yes, that looks like data—but it's not data. If I make smaller steps in the numerical calculation, you can't even tell a difference between these two theoretical solutions.





4)

> **Is a computer program building or testing a model?** Yes, the correct answer is that a computer program is **the "building a model" part of science.** You still have to test this model **by comparing it with an experiment.** If you don't test it with real world data, it might as well just be a video game.
