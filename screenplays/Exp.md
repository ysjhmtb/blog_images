1. We've received information concerning your involvement in espionage. You can either cooperate with us right now, or you'll be under arrest.
2. Tell me the story in a way that makes sense for five things.
3. If I go bowling and I throw a strike, one thing happened. 10 things didn't happen. 
4. If your house is insured for $100,000 and a tornado carries it away it carried away one house. It didn't pick up every stick of furniture and destroy it in a separate incident. If that is what you're saying well, then there is never any limit to our liability and that is the end of the insurance business.
5. It's important to our country, Jim that this man is seen as getting a fair shake. American justice will be on trial.
6. Of course, when you put it that way, it's an honor to be asked. But, Lynn, I'm an insurance lawyer. I haven't done criminal work in years.
7. You distinguished yourself at Nuremberg.
8. Jim, look at the situation. The man is publicly reviled.
9. But that's exactly why this has to be done, and capably done. It can't look like our justice system tosses people on the ash heap.
10. I told Lynn, the firm can't say no and you'd have a tough time saying no, too. I think you have to defend the son of a bitch.
11. Wait, how do you know? Did they post it on the bulletin board?
12. But it's also an honor. And the Bar Association asked me because they want to show that even a spy gets a capable advocate.
13. Oh, listen to yourself. You're defending him already. You're rehearsing it on me. You said you were just thinking about taking it.
14. So, you came over to help Jim think about whether he's taking the case?
15. You have been charged with 3 counts and 19 overt acts. Conspiracy to transmit United States defense and atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, conspiracy to gather secrets, and failing to register as a foreign agent.
16. They drove me to an airport and put me on a plane, took me off the plane.
17. I was told if I cooperated no further charges would be made against me.
18. I feel duty-bound to urge you to cooperate with the U.S. government.
19. If you are firm in your resolve not to cooperate with the U.S. government Then do not talk to anybody else about your case, inside of government or out. Except to me, to the extent that you trust me. I have a mandate to serve you. Nobody else does. Quite frankly, everybody else has an interest in sending you to the electric chair.
20. You've been selected for a mission which you are not to discuss with anyone outside of this room.
21. We are engaged in a war. This war does not, for the moment, involve men-at-arms. It involves information. You will be collecting information. You will be gathering intelligence about the enemy. The intelligence you gather could give us the upper hand in a full thermonuclear exchange with the Soviet Union. Or it could prevent one.
22. So, Jim, I heard your guy is speaking with a phony accent. Does he keep that up all the time? 
23. We all salute you for taking on a thankless task. This man has to have due process. But let's not kid each other. He'll receive a capable defense. And, God willing, he'll be convicted.
24. I'm sorry if the way I put it offends you. But we need to know what Abel is telling you. 
25. A pin-sharp panoramic camera four times as powerful as any aerial reconnaissance cameras we've ever used.
26. There was a warrant. A civil detention writ for the arrest of an alien but there was no search warrant for suspicion of criminal activity. So, the search and the evidence that is the fruit of that search that's all tainted and should not be admitted. 
27. The Department of Justice has its first allegiance to the United States. I don't see how an alien, if he's here illegally how he suffered deprivation of rights.
28. But, Roger, I don't see this as being something you ever have to worry about.
29. Your Honor, I make a motion to set aside these guilty verdicts against the weight of evidence.
30. The death sentence is not a foregone conclusion. Don't worry.
31. Standing there like that you remind me of a man who used to come to our house when I was young.
32. I just wanted to give you my two cents on the sentencing. And I thought maybe I should pester you at home as not all of my points are narrowly legal.
33. I think it could be considered in the best interests of the United States that Abel remain alive.
34. I'm not saying I've made up my mind but if he was gonna cooperate work with the government, he would've done it already.
35. You can't say it's in the best interest of the United States that he spend the rest of his days in a prison cell. How is this the national interest?
36. Not the incarceration itself, sir. It is possible that, in the foreseeable future an American of equivalent rank might be captured by Soviet Russia. We might want to have someone to trade.
37. There's nothing implausible about this one. It's entirely in the realm of what could happen. It's the kind of probability that people buy insurance for. If we send this guy to his death, we leave ourselves wide open. No policy in our back pocket for the day the storm comes.
